📌 About this project
This project was developed by me as part of a technical assignment for the company Modsen (2025).

🧑‍💻 All code was written by me from scratch.

🎨 The UI design was provided by the company for the purpose of evaluation.

🖼️ All branding/logos were replaced with neutral elements to avoid trademark usage.
